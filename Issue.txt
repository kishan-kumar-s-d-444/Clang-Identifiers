Enhance the Clang compiler by introducing two new identifiers: fq_func for retrieving the fully qualified name of the current function and mangled_func for retrieving the mangled name of the current function, similar to the func identifier.

Key Tasks

Modify the Clang frontend to support the fq_func identifier, ensuring that it retrieves the fully qualified name of the function, including namespaces and class names.
Modify the Clang frontend to support the mangled_func identifier, ensuring that it retrieves the mangled name of the function as generated by the LLVM backend.
Write test cases to validate that fq_func and mangled_func work correctly in various contexts, including different namespaces and class hierarchies.
